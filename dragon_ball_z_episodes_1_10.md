Gohan. One day, a mysterious warrior named Raditz lands on Earth. Raditz reveals himself as
Goku's older brother and discloses Goku's true Saiyan heritage. He explains that Goku was sent
to Earth as a baby to conquer the planet, but he lost his memory and became Earth's protector
instead. Raditz demands Goku join him in conquering planets, but Goku refuses. Raditz kidnaps
Gohan, giving Goku an ultimatum: defeat 100 Earthlings or never see his son again.

easily overpowers them. However, Goku's resolve remains strong as he fights to save his son
and protect Earth.
