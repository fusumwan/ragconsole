E-trition: is a comprehensive digital health brand focused on providing a one-stop intelligent
health management service. It aims to address the challenges of traditional health management,
where different processes such as data collection, analysis, and solution implementation are often
fragmented and disconnected. By offering an integrated approach, E-trition bridges these gaps,
delivering a seamless, closed-loop service that spans data monitoring, data analysis,
solution development, and precise implementation of personalized health plans.
The 3D Model: Device, Data, and Decision

components: Device, Data, and Decision.
1. Device (D):
E-trition employs smart wearable devices: to gather critical health metrics from users, providing real-
time insights into their physiological conditions. These devices are pivotal in capturing
a user's body indicators and health-related data.
2. Data (D):
The gathered health metrics are then processed through data analytics and health informatics.
E-trition integrates users' personalized health goals and dietary habits to create a comprehensive
dataset. This data-driven approach is supported by Health Io T (Internet of Things): technology,
ensuring accurate and real-time monitoring.
3. Decision (D):

personalized nutrition plans. These decisions are highly customized, taking into account not just
the raw health data but also user-specific needs, objectives, and preferences. The resulting plans are
designed to be precise, effective, and aligned with individual health goals.
Continuous Monitoring and Dynamic Adjustment
Once a personalized nutrition plan is developed, E-trition's smart wearable devices: continue to
play a vital role. They actively monitor: and collect data: on the user's adherence and
progress. This ongoing data collection includes daily health metrics, lifestyle patterns, and any
changes in user behavior. The system then uses this information to dynamically refine: and
optimize the nutrition plan, ensuring it stays in tune with the user’s evolving needs and goals.
This continuous feedback loop enables E-trition to offer a plan that not only matches the user's
health objectives but also adjusts to their real-life experiences and changing conditions. The
system provides ongoing support, helping users stay on track while also allowing for flexibility and
updates as their health status or goals change.
E-trition’s holistic approach to intelligent health management: sets a new standard for how
digital health solutions can be integrated into daily life. By using its unique 3D model of Device,
Data, and Decision, E-trition effectively bridges the gap between raw health data and actionable,

E-trition and Precision Nutrition: A New Era of Personalized Health
Introduction to E-trition's Approach to Nutrition
The term "balanced nutrition" is often perceived as a universal standard. However, individual
nutritional needs differ greatly, leading to situations where a "one-size-fits-all" approach might be
ineffective. For example, the same diet plan may work for one person but have the opposite effect on
another. This raises the question of how to define a truly balanced diet for different individuals, and
the answer lies within the evolving fields of public nutrition: and precision nutrition.
1. Public Nutrition and Its Limitations
Public nutrition, also known as social nutrition, emerged alongside the industrial revolution
when advancements in food processing and storage led to an increased focus on the relationship
between nutrition and health. This area of study aims to improve the overall health of populations by
understanding and addressing communal dietary needs. As a result, public nutrition became a stand-
alone discipline that focuses on providing generalized dietary guidelines: for the masses, such as
the widely known Food Pyramid.
However, the core limitation of public nutrition is its "one-size-fits-all": approach. It primarily
targets the nutritional needs of entire populations without accounting for individual variations. With
growing awareness about health and advancements in science and technology, there is an increasing
demand for personalized nutrition solutions, something that traditional public nutrition cannot
address effectively. This gap in the market is where precision nutrition: comes into play.
2. The Rise of Precision Nutrition
The concept of precision nutrition: originated from the personalized medicine research of the
1960s. It focuses on creating tailored nutritional recommendations and interventions: based on
an individual’s unique genetic makeup, environment, and lifestyle. As such, precision nutrition is
characterized by its individualization, preventive approach, scientific basis, and holistic
management.
A breakdown of various individual and environmental factors: that influence a person's health
and nutritional needs. These factors are divided into two categories: Individual Differences: and
Environmental Factors.
Individual Differences
These are personal characteristics that affect nutritional needs and overall health, contributing to
unique requirements for each individual. The factors include:
1. Genetic Factors:
A person's genetic makeup, inherited from their parents, can affect metabolism, nutrient
absorption, and predisposition to certain health conditions.
2. Age:
Nutritional needs change throughout life. Children, adults, and seniors all require different
nutrients and dietary considerations.
3. Gender:
Men and women have distinct nutritional requirements due to differences in hormones, body
composition, and physiological functions.
4. Lifestyle:
Daily habits and routines, such as work schedules, physical activity, and sleep patterns, significantly
impact a person's health and nutritional needs.
5. Dietary Habits:
Personal eating patterns, preferences, and cultural practices around food play a vital role in
determining nutrient intake.
6. Physiological Status:
This includes body conditions such as pregnancy, lactation, growth, illness, or physical activity
levels, which can alter nutritional requirements.
7. Psychological Status:
Emotional and mental well-being can influence dietary choices, appetite, and overall health.
8. Drug Interference:
Medications or supplements a person takes can affect nutrient absorption, metabolism, and overall
nutrition.
Environmental Factors
These are external conditions that can impact an individual's nutrition and health:
1. Temperature:
Climate and weather conditions, such as extreme heat or cold, can influence the body's
metabolism and energy needs.
2. Humidity:
The moisture levels in the environment can affect fluid balance, hydration needs, and skin health.
3. Region:
Geographic location determines the availability of certain foods, cultural dietary practices, and
exposure to different environmental conditions.
4. Social Factors:
Societal influences, including socioeconomic status, community norms, social support, and access
to healthcare, play a role in dietary choices and overall health.
The combination of individual differences: (like genetics, age, and lifestyle) and environmental
factors: (such as temperature, humidity, and social environment) forms a unique health profile for
each person. This profile is essential in developing a personalized nutrition plan: that supports
specific health goals and needs. These factors are key to the concept of precision nutrition,
where each element is considered to optimize health and well-being.
Emphasizing preventive health care, precision nutrition aims to reduce healthcare costs and alleviate
the burden on individuals and society by early intervention and ongoing health management. Given
these benefits, precision nutrition has become a research hotspot: and a mainstream health
trend in recent years.
3. E-trition: Bringing Precision Nutrition to Everyday Life
Implementing precision nutrition typically involves three key steps: individual assessment, lifestyle
evaluation, and dynamic adjustment. However, for most people, achieving these steps is a complex
and time-consuming process:
1. Individual Health Monitoring: Recording and tracking detailed health data using various
devices.
2. Scientific Assessment: Evaluating and adjusting one’s physiological characteristics, lifestyle,
and dietary habits.
3. Continuous Adjustment: Modifying the nutrition plan according to the changing physiological
stages and environmental needs.
This process requires substantial time and effort, making it difficult for the average person to
maintain. E-trition seeks to simplify this process, offering a comprehensive solution for personalized
nutrition management.
The outlines the "E-trition" system, focusing on an integrated cycle involving Device, Data,
and Decision. These components work together to facilitate a comprehensive approach to
health management and personalized nutrition. Here's a detailed breakdown of each element:
1. Device
- Device Communication: E-trition employs smart devices to collect users' health and nutrition
data. These devices communicate seamlessly with the system, enabling real-time data tracking and
updates.
- Open Platform: The E-trition platform is designed to be open and flexible, allowing the

metrics for personalized nutrition and health management.

The data aspect is central to the E-trition system, encompassing:
- Collection and Calculation: Health data is collected from devices and calculated to generate
insights into the user’s health status and nutritional needs.
- Processing and Application: The collected data is processed and then applied to create
actionable insights, forming the basis for personalized nutrition plans and health recommendations.
3. Decision
The decision-making component of E-trition focuses on three core steps:
- Diagnosis: Using the collected data, the system diagnoses the individual's health status,
identifying specific nutritional needs or gaps.
- Solution: Based on the diagnosis, a customized nutrition plan is developed to meet the user's
unique health requirements and goals.
- Intervention: The system provides continuous interventions and adjustments according to the
user’s progress and changing needs, ensuring a responsive and dynamic health management
approach.
The E-trition system operates as a closed-loop process: integrating devices, data, and decisions
to provide an intelligent, user-centric approach to nutrition and health. The Device: component
is responsible for collecting real-time health data via smart wearables and other connected
technologies. The Data: segment processes this information to enable accurate assessments and
personalized nutritional guidance. Finally, the Decision: component uses these insights to
provide informed recommendations, including diagnosis, tailored nutrition plans, and ongoing
interventions to adapt to the user’s health needs.
This cycle ensures continuous monitoring, analysis, and adjustments to the user's nutrition and
health, promoting an efficient and personalized pathway to improved well-being.
E-trition's Precision Nutrition Solution
E-trition is committed to advancing precision nutrition technology. By leveraging authoritative
theoretical frameworks such as the "Chinese Dietary Guidelines": and the "Chinese Resident
Nutrition and Chronic Disease Status Report", and in collaboration with several professional health
management institutions, E-trition has developed over 100 scientifically validated health
assessment models. These models cover aspects like balanced nutrition assessment, lifestyle
evaluation, and immune health evaluation.
#E-trition’s Smart Wearable Devices and Data Analysis
E-trition’s smart wearable devices are designed to collect multi-dimensional data, including individual
health metrics and external physical indicators. The accumulated data is then analyzed through big
data assessment models: built on years of population health data, allowing for an in-depth
understanding of a user’s daily health and body conditions. The intelligent system accurately
identifies the user’s nutritional needs and intake, creating a personalized and precision nutrition
plan: based on the user’s health goals and real-time nutrition requirements.
This streamlined process bridges the final gap in precision nutrition management, making it easier
for individuals to access and benefit from personalized nutritional guidance.

their daily lives. E-trition’s solution involves the Smart Nutrition Plus: device paired with high-
quality nutritional supplements: and Special Nutrition Packs. These offerings enable

E-trition | Empowering Mothers to be Uniquely Themselves
Celebrating Mothers Amidst Life’s Chaos
Amidst the noise and bustle of daily life, mothers often remain behind the scenes, silently making
countless sacrifices. In traditional Chinese family structures, the mother is not only the cornerstone
of the family but also the heart and soul of the kitchen. They tirelessly provide warmth and care,
pouring their heart and soul into their family. Each family's version of stir-fried tomato and eggs
carries the unique flavor and love of a mother, a signature that makes every dish special.
The “taste” of a mother’s cooking is a memory that lingers long into adulthood, often becoming an
emotional sanctuary. Imagine a tired Saturday where you order a plate of stir-fried tomato and eggs,
only to realize that it lacks the sweetness you remember. Then, you recall how your mother’s version
always had a unique touch—because she knew your childhood preferences. The dish wasn’t just
about flavor; it embodied the love, care, and memories she created.
However, mothers' sacrifices often go unnoticed in the mundane details of life. Their efforts and
dedication are taken as a matter of course, bound to the kitchen and family roles. Traditionally, the
phrase "a gentleman stays away from the kitchen" diminishes the significance of a mother’s work.
Yet, it is crucial to acknowledge that a mother’s devotion should not be taken for granted. They need
our understanding, respect, and support to break free from the invisible "chains" of household
responsibilities.
E-trition is the key: to unlocking that freedom.

I I. Sales Incentives
The company allocates 20% of total performance revenue: as sales incentives, distributed across four
reward types: Promotion Reward, Performance Reward, Leadership Reward, and Honorary Reward.
#1. Promotion Reward
1. First Generation: A 20% reward: of the initial purchase amount is given for directly referred
members (immediate calculation).
2. Second and Third Generations: A 3% reward: from the initial purchase amount is granted for
the second and third generations, valid during the first 100 days: of the company’s launch.
##Promotion Reward Calculation Example:
- If Timothy: directly refers May, who makes an initial purchase of H K$4,000: (V1), Timothy
receives 20%, or H K$800.
- If May: refers John, who purchases H K$8,000: (V2), May receives 20%, or
H K$1,600, and Timothy receives 3%, or H K$240.
- If John: refers Sum, who purchases H K$16,000: (V3), John receives 20%, or
H K$3,200, May receives 3%, or H K$480, and Timothy receives 3%, or H K$480.
#2. Performance Reward
The performance reward rate varies by distributor level:
- V1 to Crown Ambassador: From 0.5% to 5%.
- Weekly maximum reward limits apply, ranging from H K$120 for V1: to H K$6,000 for Crown
Ambassador.
Performance rewards are calculated based on the downline's performance and the applicable
percentage.
They can only be earned from downline distributors.
#3. Leadership Reward
Leadership rewards depend on the distributor level, entitling rewards from a maximum of 8
generations. Each generation’s performance reward is subject to a 10% leadership reward.
#4. Honorary Reward
- Honorary reward percentages vary by rank, ranging from 2% to 8%, based on direct downline
performance rewards.
- Calculated and distributed monthly.
#5. One-Star Diamond Profit Sharing
2% of the total performance revenue: is allocated to a profit-sharing fund, distributed among
distributors at the One-Star Diamond level and above. Calculated and distributed monthly.
I I I. Upgrade Rules
1. Upgrade Points/U V: Each rank has a specific U V requirement, which can be earned through re-
purchases or by referring new members.
2. Upgrade to Gold Diamond Ambassador: Requires having three Three-Star Diamond: downline
members.
3. Upgrade to Crown Ambassador: Requires having three Gold Diamond Ambassador: downline
members.
Upgrades are possible by either re-purchasing products: or referring new members: to gain U V
points.
I V. Repurchase Reward Rules
1. 10% Deduction for Repurchase Fund: A 10% deduction: from all initial and re-purchase reward
income (covering promotion, performance, leadership, and honorary rewards) is placed in a personal
repurchase fund pool. Once the pool reaches H K$800, it qualifies for a repurchase and reward
calculation.
2. Qualified Repurchase: A repurchase of H K$800: qualifies for one calculation of promotion,
performance, and leadership rewards. Repurchase is required every three months: to maintain active
status; otherwise, rewards are suspended until repurchase is made.
V. Withdrawal Rules
Distributors can withdraw their rewards once the amount reaches H K$200.
V I. F I M Membership and Incentive System Rules
The interpretation and enforcement: of the F I M incentive system rules rest solely with the company.
All F I M members are required to adhere to the rules, and all purchase amounts are non-
refundable.
V I I. Upgrade Calculation Example
If a V1 distributor: wishes to upgrade to V2, they can choose from the following options:
1. Full Re-Purchase for Upgrade: Pay the full price difference to meet V2 requirements.
2. Pay the Difference: V2 requires H K$8,000: while V1 requires H K$4,000; thus, pay the
additional H K$4,000: to upgrade.
3. Upgrade Through Referral: By referring a One-Star Diamond: (equivalent to 4 U V), a V1
distributor with 0.5 U V: accumulates 4.5 U V: and upgrades directly to V3.
V I I I. Performance and Leadership Reward Calculation Example
Assume a direct sales network with three generations of distributors. Weekly calculations are as
follows:
1. Monday: Timothy: (1st distributor) joins and makes an H K$8,000: purchase (V2).
2. Tuesday: Timothy re-purchases H K$8,000: five times, accumulating 6 U V.
3. Wednesday: Timothy refers May: (2nd distributor), who makes a H K$32,000: purchase
(One-Star Diamond).
4. Thursday: Timothy refers John: (3rd distributor), who makes a H K$4,000: purchase (V1).
5. Friday: May refers Sum: (4th distributor) and Peter: (5th distributor), both making
H K$16,000: purchases (V3).
Calculation of Performance Reward for Timothy:
- Since Sum and Timothy are both V3, further calculations are evenly split.
- Formula: \[(Timothy’s purchases + May's purchase + John’s purchase) × 2% + (Sum’s purchase +
Peter’s
purchase) × 2% / 2\] × 20% = H K$400.
This example shows how weekly performance and leadership rewards are calculated, subject to
maximum
limits by rank.
I X. Leadership Reward Calculation Example
Leadership rewards depend on the number of generations eligible for the reward:
- A One-Star Diamond: referring 10 One-Star Diamond distributors: (first generation), each with a
maximum weekly reward of H K$1,500, will result in:
- Leadership Reward Calculation: Total reward = 10 × H K$1,500 = H K$15,000.
- Leadership Reward Earned: H K$15,000 × 10% = H K$1,500.
X. Honorary Reward Calculation Example
Honorary rewards are based on rank differences within the network:
1. Example 1: A Two-Star Diamond: distributor (A) has a direct downline One-Star
Diamond: distributor (B). A: receives 5%: of B’s: performance reward.
2. Example 2: A Three-Star Diamond: distributor (C) has a direct downline V1: distributor
(D). C: receives 6%: of D’s: performance reward.
3. Example 3: If Timothy: (100th position, V1) has a direct upline (99th position, Three-Star
Diamond), the 99th distributor receives 6%: of Timothy's performance reward. If an 80th position
Gold Diamond Ambassador: exists, they receive an additional 1%: (the difference between 7%
for Gold Diamond and 6%: for Three-Star Diamond).
These examples illustrate how honorary rewards are calculated based on rank differentials,
promoting the
growth of direct downline networks.
The F I M incentive system is designed to incentivize distributors through multi-layered rewards
(promotion, performance, leadership, and honorary), encouraging the recruitment of new members,
consistent re-purchases, and support for downline growth. This comprehensive structure provides a
fair,
transparent, and performance-based approach to reward distribution.
F I M Incentive System Rules - Detailed Overview (Effective January 29, 2024)
I. Eligibility for Participation (Four Categories)
• Participation Levels and Initial Purchase: The F I M system defines four levels of distributor
participation,
which are determined by the amount of the initial product purchase. Upon meeting the required
purchase
amount, participants are granted a specific distributor rank and a certain amount of F S V (Financial
Stability
Value) points purchasing rights. The following are the categories:
1. V1 Distributor: A participant becomes a V1 distributor by making an initial product purchase of H
K$4,000,
which is equivalent to 0.5 U V (Upgrade Value). This level grants 500U in F S V points purchasing
rights.
2. V2 Distributor: A participant qualifies as a V2 distributor with an initial product purchase of H
K$8,000,
equating to 1 U V. This level allows the participant to acquire 1,000U in F S V points.
3. V3 Distributor: An individual reaches the V3 distributor level by purchasing products worth H
K$16,000,
equivalent to 2 U V. This provides 2,000U in F S V points purchasing rights.
4. One-Star Diamond Distributor: A participant is promoted to a One-Star Diamond distributor after
making
an initial purchase of H K$32,000, equating to 4 U V. This category provides 4,000U in F S V points
purchasing
rights.
• Notes on U V and Product Selection:
o Product Package Choice: Participants may select product packages equivalent to the required value
for
their distributor level.
o U V (Upgrade Value): U V represents the "Upgrade Value," which is used as a measure for level
upgrades
within the system.

I I. Sales Incentives (Available to All Distributor Levels)
• Total Performance Revenue Allocation: The company dedicates 20% of its total performance
revenue
to sales incentives. These incentives are divided into four distinct categories: Promotion Reward,
Performance Reward, Leadership Reward, and Honorary Reward.
1. Rules for Promotion Reward
• Direct Referral - First Generation (20%): Any distributor, irrespective of their level, is eligible to earn
a
20% promotion reward from the initial purchase amount of their directly referred (first-generation)
member.
This incentive is calculated instantly upon the completion of the purchase.
• Second and Third Generation Referrals (3% Each): Distributors can also earn a promotion reward of
3%
from the initial purchase amounts of their second-generation and third-generation referrals. This
serves as an
entrepreneurial bonus for the first 100 days of the company's and system's launch.
• First Purchase Equals New Order Revenue: The first purchase made by a new distributor is treated
as
"new order revenue," which qualifies for the calculation of promotion rewards.

Example of Promotion Reward Calculation
The following example illustrates how the Promotion Reward: is calculated within a direct sales
network.
Assume a simple structure consisting of three generations of distributors, and the calculation is
based on their
direct referral relationships and the first purchase amount.
The example includes four members within the network: Timothy, May, John, and Sum. The
promotion
reward is based on the percentage of the first purchase amount of each referred member, calculated
according
to the provided rules.
Rules for Promotion Reward Calculation
1. First Generation Referral: 20% of the first purchase amount.
2. Second Generation Referral: 3% of the first purchase amount.
3. Third Generation Referral: 3% of the first purchase amount.
#Step-by-Step Calculation Process
1. Timothy Refers May:
- May makes a first purchase of H K$4,000: (V1 level).
- Timothy’s Promotion Reward: May’s first purchase amount \\* First Generation Referral
Percentage
= H K$4,000 \\* 20%: = H K$800.
2. May Refers John:
- John makes a first purchase of H K$8,000: (V2 level).
- May’s Promotion Reward: John’s first purchase amount \\* First Generation Referral Percentage
= H K$8,000 \\* 20%: = H K$1,600.
- Timothy’s Second Generation Reward: Since Timothy is May’s upline, he also earns a reward
from John’s purchase.
John’s first purchase amount \\* Second Generation Referral Percentage
= H K$8,000 \\* 3%: = H K$240.
3. John Refers Sum:
- Sum makes a first purchase of H K$16,000: (V3 level).
- John’s Promotion Reward: Sum’s first purchase amount \\* First Generation Referral Percentage
= H K$16,000 \\* 20%: = H K$3,200.
- May’s Second Generation Reward: As May is John’s upline, she also earns a reward from
Sum’s purchase.
Sum’s first purchase amount \\* Second Generation Referral Percentage
= H K$16,000 \\* 3%: = H K$480.
- Timothy’s Third Generation Reward: Since Timothy is May’s upline (and John’s grand-upline),
he receives a third-generation reward from Sum’s purchase.
Sum’s first purchase amount \\* Third Generation Referral Percentage
= H K$16,000 \\* 3%: = H K$480.
Summary of Results
- Timothy’s Total Promotion Reward:
= H K$800: (from May) + H K$240: (from John) + H K$480: (from Sum)
= H K$1,520.
- May’s Total Promotion Reward:
= H K$1,600: (from John) + H K$480: (from Sum)
= H K$2,080.
- John’s Total Promotion Reward:
= H K$3,200: (from Sum).
- Sum: Since Sum has no direct referrals, no promotion reward is allocated to Sum.
This detailed calculation process demonstrates how the Promotion Reward is distributed based on
the direct
referral relationships within a direct sales network and the initial purchase amount of each referred
member.
2. Performance Reward Rules
Overview of Performance Reward Rates and Maximum Weekly Bonus
Each distributor level has a specific performance reward rate and a corresponding maximum weekly
bonus.
The details for each level are as follows:
- V1 Distributors: Eligible for a 0.5% performance reward share, with a maximum weekly bonus
of H K$120.
- V2 Distributors: Eligible for a 1% performance reward share, with a maximum weekly bonus of
H K$300.
- V3 Distributors: Eligible for a 2% performance reward share, with a maximum weekly bonus of
H K$700.
- One-Star Diamond Distributors: Eligible for a 3% performance reward share, with a maximum
weekly bonus of H K$1,500.
- Two-Star Diamond Distributors: Eligible for a 3.5% performance reward share, with a maximum
weekly bonus of H K$2,500.
- Three-Star Diamond Distributors: Eligible for a 4% performance reward share, with a maximum
weekly bonus of H K$3,500.
- Gold Diamond Ambassadors: Eligible for a 4.5% performance reward share, with a maximum
weekly bonus of H K$4,500.
- Crown Ambassadors: Eligible for a 5% performance reward share, with a maximum weekly bonus
of H K$6,000.
2.1 Distributor Order
The first distributor who joins is marked as Number 1, followed by Number 2, and so forth as new
distributors join the network sequentially.
2.2 Performance Rewards Covered by the Company
All levels of distributors are eligible for the performance rewards, which are financed by the
company. This
ensures that every distributor, regardless of rank, can benefit from the performance reward system.
2.3 Weekly Allocation of 20% of Company Performance
Every week, the company allocates 20% of the total company performance revenue: to all distributor
levels. The performance rewards are distributed to distributors based on their level-specific rates.
Any
remaining funds that are not distributed as rewards are accumulated into a performance pool, which
strengthens confidence in the company’s financial stability.
2.4 Rules for Earning Performance Rewards
- Calculation Based on Downline Performance: The performance reward is determined by multiplying
the distributor’s performance by their eligible reward percentage. The reward is subject to the
maximum weekly bonus limit for each distributor level.
- Rewards Earned Solely from Downline Activity: Distributors can only earn performance rewards
from
the activities of their downline: distributors (those who join after them in the network). They cannot
earn
performance rewards from their upline: (distributors who joined before them).
- Example: If you are the 3rd distributor: to join, you can only earn performance rewards from the
4th distributor: and those who join subsequently. You are not entitled to earn rewards from the 1st
and
2nd distributors.
2.5 Fixed Product Purchase Amounts for Level Upgrades
Distributors must purchase products in fixed amounts of H K$4,000, H K$8,000, H K$16,000, or
H K$32,000. This structure aligns with the upgrade rules: (outlined in Section 6). Accumulating
sufficient upgrade points through purchases will qualify a distributor for a level upgrade.
2.6 Equal Sharing of Performance Among Distributors
All distributors are considered to be at the same hierarchical level within the performance reward
system.
Therefore, the performance calculations for the rewards earned from each downline distributor are
equally
shared.
This structure ensures a fair distribution of performance rewards based on the level, purchase
amounts, and
sequence of joining. The system encourages active participation and upgrading through continued
purchases
and recruitment within the network.
Example of Performance Reward Calculation
The following example illustrates the process of calculating the Performance Reward: within a direct
sales network, assuming a simple structure that includes three generations of distributors. The
example
demonstrates how to determine performance rewards based on the activities and initial purchases
of the
network members.
Assumptions for Calculation
Week One Activities
- Monday:
- A new member, Timothy, joins the network as the 1st distributor. He makes an initial purchase
of H K$8,000, which qualifies him as a V2 distributor.
- Tuesday:
- Timothy: makes an additional purchase of H K$8,000: five times, termed as a "re-purchase"
(original point re-purchase), which contributes to his upgrade points (U V).
- Upgrade Points Calculation: The re-purchase multiplies Timothy’s upgrade value by 5, resulting in
1 \\* 5 = 5 U V. Adding his initial 1 U V, Timothy’s total upgrade points are 6 U V, promoting him
to a V3 distributor.
- Wednesday:
- Timothy: recruits a new member, May, who becomes the 2nd distributor. May: makes
a first purchase of H K$32,000, qualifying her as a One-Star Diamond distributor.
- Thursday:
- Timothy: recruits another member, John, who becomes the 3rd distributor. John: makes
a first purchase of H K$4,000, qualifying him as a V1 distributor.
- Friday:
- May: recruits two additional members: Sum: (4th distributor) and Peter: (5th distributor).
They each make a first purchase of H K$16,000, qualifying both as V3 distributors.
Performance Reward Calculation for Timothy
When Sum: joins as the 4th distributor, he achieves the same level as Timothy: (both are V3
distributors). Therefore, any performance reward calculated for Timothy from downline activities
must be
evenly distributed among the downline members at the same level.
Formula for Calculation:
\[
[( \text{Timothy's Total Purchase} + \text{May's Purchase} + \text{John's Purchase} ) \times 2\% +
(\text{Sum's Purchase} + \text{Peter's Purchase}) \times 2\% / 2 ] \times 20\%
\]
Breaking down the formula:
- Timothy's Total Purchase: H K$8,000: (initial) + H K$8,000 × 5: (re-purchase) =
H K$48,000.
- May's Purchase: H K$32,000.
- John's Purchase: H K$4,000.
- Sum and Peter's Purchases: Each makes a purchase of H K$16,000.
Plugging in values:
\[
[( H K\$48,000 + H K\$32,000 + H K\$4,000 ) \times 2\% + ( H K\$16,000 + H K\$16,000 ) \times 2\% /
2 ]
\times 20\% = \text{H K\$400}
\]
Summary of the Performance Reward Calculation Process
1. Calculate the total performance: for the entire team based on their purchases.
2. Allocate the reward according to the level: of each distributor and their downline's performance.
3. Each level has a weekly cap: on the maximum bonus, ensuring that rewards do not exceed this
limit.
4. A distributor’s actual performance reward is calculated based on contributions from their direct
downline. The reward amount cannot exceed the maximum bonus set for their level.
5. Accurate Calculation: The correct calculation requires comprehensive data on the performance of
all
downline members to accurately reflect the contribution to each distributor's performance reward.
This example outlines the principles of the performance reward calculation in a direct sales system.
3. Leadership Reward Rules (Calculated for Each Generation)
Leadership Reward Distribution by Distributor Level
Each level of distributor is entitled to receive leadership rewards for a certain number of generations
of their
downline, all at a fixed 10% reward rate. The breakdown by level is as follows:
- V1 Distributor: Earns leadership rewards from 1 generation: at 10%.
- V2 Distributor: Earns leadership rewards from 2 generations: at 10%.
- V3 Distributor: Earns leadership rewards from 3 generations: at 10%.
- One-Star Diamond Distributor: Earns leadership rewards from 4 generations: at 10%.
- Two-Star Diamond Distributor: Earns leadership rewards from 5 generations: at 10%.
- Three-Star Diamond Distributor: Earns leadership rewards from 6 generations: at 10%.
- Gold Diamond Ambassador: Earns leadership rewards from 7 generations: at 10%.
- Crown Ambassador: Earns leadership rewards from 8 generations: at 10%.
This structure ensures that the higher a distributor’s rank, the more generations they benefit from in
terms
of leadership rewards, but the reward rate is consistently set at 10%.
Additional Information on Leadership Rewards
1. 10% of Performance Rewards across 8 Generations:
- The leadership reward is based on the performance rewards earned by downline distributors.
Specifically,
10% of the performance reward: is distributed across up to 8 generations. This distribution allows
for substantial additional earnings for distributors and is estimated to account for up to 16%: of the
total
funds set aside by the company for rewards.
2. Calculation Based on Referral Relationships:
- The leadership reward is determined by the direct and indirect referral relationships of the
distributor
within the network. Unlike honorary rewards, which may have certain deductions based on rank
differences,
leadership rewards are calculated based solely on the performance rewards of direct and indirect
downlines.
Example of Leadership Reward Calculation
To better understand how the leadership reward is calculated, let’s consider a practical example
involving
a simple direct sales network.
Assumptions:
- You are a One-Star Diamond: distributor.
- You have directly referred 10 One-Star Diamond distributors: as your first generation.
- Each of these One-Star Diamond distributors reaches their maximum weekly performance bonus of
H K$1,500: within one week.
Calculation of Leadership Reward:
1. Total Performance Rewards of First Generation:
- Each One-Star Diamond distributor has a maximum bonus of H K$1,500.
- Total performance rewards for the first generation: 10 distributors × H K$1,500: = H K$15,000.
2. Leadership Reward Calculation:
- The leadership reward is 10%: of the performance rewards from the downline generation.
- Leadership Reward: = H K$15,000 × 10%: = H K$1,500.
Therefore, as a One-Star Diamond distributor, you receive H K$1,500: as a leadership reward from
the total performance rewards earned by your directly referred first-generation distributors.
Summary
This example illustrates how a distributor can calculate their leadership reward based on the
performance rewards of their downline distributors. The leadership reward mechanism encourages
distributors to build a robust downline network and benefits them financially based on their
network’s performance. This reward system aims to incentivize distributors who effectively expand
their business and support their downline
members to achieve better performance.
4. Honorary Reward Rules (Calculated for Each Generation): 2-8%
Honorary Reward Rates by Distributor Level
The honorary reward is a percentage of the performance bonuses of a distributor's downline. The
percentage
of the honorary reward varies according to the distributor’s rank, as follows:
- V1 Distributor: Not eligible for the honorary reward.
- V2 Distributor: Eligible for a 2% honorary reward.
- V3 Distributor: Eligible for a 3% honorary reward.
- One-Star Diamond Distributor: Eligible for a 4% honorary reward.
- Two-Star Diamond Distributor: Eligible for a 5% honorary reward.
- Three-Star Diamond Distributor: Eligible for a 6% honorary reward.
- Gold Diamond Ambassador: Eligible for a 7% honorary reward.
- Crown Ambassador: Eligible for the highest rate of 8% honorary reward.
As the distributor level increases, the percentage of the honorary reward also rises, with the
maximum being
8% for Crown Ambassadors.
Details on Calculation and Distribution of Honorary Rewards
1. Direct Line Performance-Based Reward (2-8%):
- The honorary reward is calculated as a percentage of the performance bonus earned by the
distributor's
direct downline members. This percentage ranges from 2% to 8%, depending on the distributor's
level.
2. Monthly Calculation and Distribution:
- The honorary reward is calculated and distributed on a monthly basis. The process ensures that the
rewards are accurately allocated according to the rank-based differences among distributors.
Key Concepts of Honorary Reward Distribution
- Level Coverage:
- The honorary reward applies to distributors from V2 to Crown Ambassador: levels. The percentage
is determined based on the performance bonuses of the direct downline members.
- Reward Distribution Percentage:
- The reward percentage varies by level, starting from 2% for V2: distributors and rising to a
maximum
of 8% for Crown Ambassadors.
- Method of Calculation:
- Honorary rewards are calculated and distributed once a month. The percentage is based on the
distributor's
level relative to their downline, ensuring a fair distribution aligned with the hierarchical rank.
- Payment Responsibility:
- All honorary rewards are fully paid by the company. Distributors are not required to cover any
portion
of the reward payments.
- Definition of Direct Line (Upline/Downline):
- If Person A: is ranked higher than Person B, then Person A: is Person B’s direct upline.
- Conversely, if Person A: is ranked lower than Person B, then Person A: is considered
Person B’s direct downline.
Summary
The honorary reward system incentivizes distributors to grow their direct downline network
effectively. As
distributors advance to higher ranks, they become eligible for a higher percentage of the
performance bonuses
earned by their downline members. The monthly distribution of honorary rewards ensures that the
payments
are made fairly and consistently, with all costs fully covered by the company.
Honorary Reward Calculation Examples
The calculation of honorary rewards: is based on the performance bonuses of a distributor's direct
downline members and is determined by the difference in rank between the upline and downline
distributors.
All honorary rewards are fully paid by the company.
Example of Honorary Reward Calculations
#Example 1:
Suppose Distributor A: is at the Two-Star Diamond: level, and their direct downline, Distributor
B, is at the One-Star Diamond: level. In this scenario, Distributor A: is entitled to receive an
honorary reward of 5%: from the performance bonus earned by Distributor B. This is because the
honorary reward percentage for a Two-Star Diamond relative to a One-Star Diamond is 5%.
#Example 2:
If Distributor C: is at the Three-Star Diamond: level and their direct downline, Distributor D,
is at the V1: level, then Distributor C: can earn 6%: of the performance bonus from Distributor
D. This is because the honorary reward percentage for a Three-Star Diamond relative to a V1
distributor
is 6%. If there is an even higher-ranked distributor in the same direct sales chain (e.g., a Gold
Diamond
Ambassador), they would receive an additional honorary reward based on the rank difference.
#Example 3:
If Timothy: has a V1: direct downline at the 100th position, and the 99th distributor
(Timothy’s direct upline) is at the Three-Star Diamond: level, then the 99th distributor can receive
6%: of the performance bonus from Timothy’s activities. This is because the honorary reward
percentage for a Three-Star Diamond relative to a V1 distributor is 6%.
However, if distributors from the 98th to the 81st positions: are all below the Three-Star Diamond
level,
they are not eligible to receive any honorary rewards from Timothy’s performance bonus. If the 80th
distributor: is a Gold Diamond Ambassador, they can earn the difference in percentage: between
their level and the Three-Star Diamond level. Specifically, they would receive 7% - 6% = 1%: of the
performance bonus from Timothy’s activities. In this mathematical formula:
- 7%: represents the Gold Diamond Ambassador’s honorary reward percentage.
- 6%: represents the Three-Star Diamond’s honorary reward percentage.
Summary of Honorary Reward Calculations
These examples illustrate how honorary rewards are calculated based on rank differences within a
direct sales
network. The system encourages distributors to expand their direct downline network, with rewards
calculated from the rank differential of performance bonuses. The honorary reward system
incentivizes higher
rank advancement, ensuring that distributors are appropriately rewarded for the growth and
performance of
their direct downline members.
5. One-Star Diamond Profit Sharing Rules
The One-Star Diamond Profit Sharing: is a system where 2% of the company’s total performance
revenue: is allocated into a profit-sharing pool. This pool is then distributed to eligible distributors
based on a weighted average (represented by the K value). The calculation and distribution of the
diamond
profit-sharing occur once a month. Only distributors who have achieved the rank of One-Star
Diamond or higher: are entitled to receive this profit-sharing benefit. The distribution is equally
averaged
among all eligible members.
6. Upgrade Rules
The upgrade system is based on Upgrade Value (U V): points, which differ by rank. Below is a
breakdown
of how U V points are allocated and the requirements for advancing to the next rank:
- Corresponding U V Points for Each Rank:
- V1 Distributor: 0.5 U V
- V2 Distributor: 1 U V
- V3 Distributor: 2 U V
- One-Star Diamond Distributor: 4 U V
- Two-Star Diamond Distributor: No displayed U V points.
- Three-Star Diamond Distributor: No displayed U V points.
- Gold Diamond Ambassador: No displayed U V points.
- Crown Ambassador: No displayed U V points.
- Qualifying U V Points for Advancement:
- V1 Distributor: 0.5 U V
- V2 Distributor: 3 U V
- V3 Distributor: 6 U V
- One-Star Diamond Distributor: 12 U V
- Two-Star Diamond Distributor: 24 U V
- Three-Star Diamond Distributor: 48 U V
- Gold Diamond Ambassador: Requires 3 Three-Star Diamond: downline members.
- Crown Ambassador: Requires 3 Gold Diamond Ambassador: downline members.
This table outlines the required U V points for upgrading from one rank to another, from V1: to
Crown
Ambassador. Advancement is achieved by either accumulating U V points: or recruiting downline
members.
Specific Upgrade Rules
6.1. Full Re-Purchase for Instant Upgrade:
Distributors can upgrade by making a full re-purchase: (known as an original point re-purchase).
6.2. Advancement Through Referral:
Upgrading U V points can also be accumulated through referrals.
6.3. Upgrading to Gold Diamond Ambassador:
A distributor must have three Three-Star Diamond: downline members to qualify.
6.4. Upgrading to Crown Ambassador:
A distributor must have three Gold Diamond Ambassador: downline members to qualify.
6.5. Accumulating U V Through Re-Purchase:
For example, a V2 distributor: originally has 1 U V. By making an additional five re-purchases
of products worth H K$8,000 each, the distributor’s U V points increase by 1 × 5 = 5 U V. When
added to the original 1 U V, the distributor has a total of 6 U V, qualifying them for an upgrade to
V3.
6.6. Accumulating U V Through Referrals:
For example, a V2 distributor: with 1 U V: can also upgrade by referring five V2 members.
Each referral grants 1 U V, so referring five V2 members provides an additional 5 U V. Adding this
to the original 1 U V: results in a total of 6 U V, qualifying the distributor for an upgrade to V3.
6.7. Upgrade by Recruiting a Higher-Rank Member:
A V2 distributor: can immediately upgrade to V3: by recruiting a new member of the V3 rank.
Example Calculation for Upgrading
Scenario: A V1 distributor: wants to upgrade to V2.
- Option 1: Full Re-Purchase
The distributor can make a full re-purchase that matches the V2 rank requirements.
- Option 2: Pay the Difference
Since V2 requires H K$8,000: and V1 requires H K$4,000, the distributor can pay the remaining
H K$4,000: to upgrade.
- Option 3: Referral for Upgrade Points
A V1 distributor: like Peter: can refer a One-Star Diamond distributor. Since a referral to a
One-Star Diamond yields 4 U V, Peter’s total qualifying U V points become 0.5 + 4 = 4 U V,
allowing him to upgrade directly to V3.
7. Repurchase Reward Rules
1. Deduction for Personal Repurchase Fund Pool:
For all initial purchases and original point re-purchases, 10% of the reward income: from the
following four types—Promotion Reward, Performance Reward, Leadership Reward, and Honorary
Reward—is deducted and placed into a Personal Repurchase Fund Pool. Once the accumulated
amount in the pool reaches H K D 800, the distributor becomes eligible to make a qualified
repurchase, which qualifies them to calculate rewards once. If the amount exceeds the required H K
D
800, the surplus will roll over to the next repurchase cycle and continue accumulating in the Personal
Unit Repurchase Fund Pool: for subsequent eligibility and reward calculations.
2. Qualified Repurchase and Reward Calculation:
A qualified repurchase of H K D 800: allows for one reward calculation, which includes the
Promotion Reward, Performance Reward, and Leadership Reward. The repurchase can accumulate
for
future calculations.
3. Repurchase Every Three Months for Active Status:
To maintain an active status, distributors must make a qualified repurchase every three months.
4. Penalty for Missing Repurchase:
If a distributor fails to make a repurchase within three months, they will not be eligible for their
Promotion Reward, Performance Reward, or Leadership Reward: until they complete a repurchase to
regain active status.
8. Withdrawal Rules
Distributors can withdraw their reward income once it reaches a minimum of H K D 200.
I I I. F I M Membership System and F I M Incentive System Rules
1. Authority and Compliance:
The interpretation and enforcement rights: of the F I M incentive system and its rules are vested
solely
in the company. All F I M members must comply with the rules and regulations: of the incentive
system
for their operations.
2. Instant Calculation and Non-Refundable:
The F I M incentive system operates on a model where product purchases: are directly linked to
instant reward calculations. Once a distributor registers and makes a purchase within the F I M
distributor
system, the reward calculation is instantly processed after verification. All purchase amounts are final
and
non-refundable.
This detailed structure emphasizes the processes involved in accumulating rewards, maintaining
active status
through repurchases, and the conditions for withdrawal.
